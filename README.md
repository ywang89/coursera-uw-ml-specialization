# Notes

This is my repo for course ["Machine Learning: Regression"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression) on Coursera. This mainly collects my solution to the course's programming assignments.

## Week 1: Simple Linear Regression

[Programming Assignment](https://github.com/ywang89/coursera_ml_regression/blob/master/week-1/week-1-simple-regression-assignment.ipynb)

Implemented a generic simple linear regression in Python.

## Week 2: Multiple Linear Regression

* [Programming Assignment](https://github.com/ywang89/coursera_ml_regression/blob/master/week-2/week-2-multiple-regression-assignment-1.ipynb)
* [Programming Assignment](https://github.com/ywang89/coursera_ml_regression/blob/master/week-2/week-2-multiple-regression-assignment-2.ipynb)

Implemented gradient descent for multiple regression.

## Week 3: Assessing Performance

[Programming Assignment](https://github.com/ywang89/coursera_ml_regression/blob/master/week-3/week-3-polynomial-regression-assignment.ipynb)

Explored the trade-off between variance and bias.

## Week 4: Ridge Regression

* [Programming Assignment 1](https://github.com/ywang89/coursera_ml_regression/blob/master/week-4/week-4-ridge-regression-assignment-1.ipynb)
* [Programming Assignment 2](https://github.com/ywang89/coursera_ml_regression/blob/master/week-4/week-4-ridge-regression-assignment-2.ipynb)

Implemented ridge regression via gradient descent in Python.

## Week 5: Feature Selection & Lasso

* [Programming Assignment 1](https://github.com/ywang89/coursera_ml_regression/blob/master/week-5/week-5-lasso-assignment-1.ipynb)
* [Programming Assignment 2](https://github.com/ywang89/coursera_ml_regression/blob/master/week-5/week-5-lasso-assignment-2.ipynb)

Implemented lasso regression using coordinate descent in Python.

## Week 6: Nearest Neighbors & Kernel Regression

[Programming Assignment](https://github.com/ywang89/coursera_ml_regression/blob/master/week-6/week-6-local-regression-assignment.ipynb)

Implemented a K-nearest neighbors regression in Python and used it to predict house prices.
